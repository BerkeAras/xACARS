## What do all of the files manage?
```
config.py - Handles reading the .ini files, and creates them if they do not exist
getBid.pyw - Gets a bid from the user
listAirlines.pyw - Lists airlines, and manages the creation and editing of them
login.pyw - Runs the login window
main.pyw - Runs the main window
posUpdateLoop.pyw - Bugs the program to refresh data in the input folder for fresh data from FSUIPC/XPUIPC
settings.pyw - Runs the settings window
track.pyw - Tracks the flight and updates its position.
web.py - Interfaces between the web and the program. Basically the requests module, except sends the headers without an extra field.
